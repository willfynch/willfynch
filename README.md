# About me

ðŸ”­ Hello ! I am William Finzy, an aspiring web developer, on a special trip to front-end development ! I used to be a chemical engineer but I somewhat wanted another path for my career and I landed here. 
  ðŸŒ± I am currently learning the basics of React and improving my vanilla JS skills as well. 
  ðŸ‘¯ I am looking forward to collaborating on open source projects, especially those involving biology stuff !
